# text adventure game in c
I always wanted to make one in c, i love this kind of challenge
and i always loved writing c code, tho string manipulation is
a pain in the ear :P

but for the moment it is pretty empty, but i can kinda ilustrate
my progress with a todo list:
- [ ] game system
    - [x] map system
    - [ ] static map building
    - [ ] inventory system
    - [ ] npc system
    - [ ] dialogue system
    - [x] game api
- [ ] parse system
    - [ ] string tokenizing (is not good at all for the moment)
    - [x] command mapping
    - [x] handling system
    - [x] parse api
- [ ] http API
- [ ] front end

> for the front end i can implement an http API and make a web
front end or a simple cli client, kinda overkill tbh but may be
fun idk

> OR i can just have a simple io system that is hardcoded to the
game which is kinda boring but fair
